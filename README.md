## Motivation

* #### Can We Automate Scientific Reviewing?
* #### How will we know if we succeed?
* #### Heavy workload on reviewing papers?  ReviewAdvisor helps out!


## Demo

(The Demo is currently offline due to computational consideration. We will re-start it once the computational resource is sufficient.)

#### Have a [TRY](http://review.nlpedia.ai/)




## Dataset
(The dataset is under Apache-2.0 license)

To download our dataset, run
```bash
sh download_dataset.sh
```
There will be a **dataset** folder that contains the data. Please read the README.md in **dataset** folder to know more about the details.

To use our trained tagger, run
```bash
sh download_tagger.sh
```
There will be a **seqlab_final** folder that contains our trained tagger. Move it into the **tagger** folder in this repo. The detailed usage of our tagger can be refered [here](https://github.com/neulab/ReviewAdvisor/tree/main/tagger).


## Evaluation
We first define two high-level objectives of scientific peer review following [Jefferson et al. (2002a)](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/194989). and [Smith (2006)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1420798/).

1. Selecting high-quality submissions for publication.
2. Improving different aspects  of a paper by providing detailed comments.

We then make the first step towards review evaluation for scientific papers by proposing seven quantifiable metrics that can characterize a review from multiple perspectives. The evaluation metrics are shown in Fig.1, red represents absolute metric and blue represents relative metric.

## Model
We decompose review generation into two steps, and consider using a *extract-then-generate* paradigm. 

We consider three extraction strategies, which can be visualized in Fig.2.
1. Section-based Extraction
2. Cross-entropy Method Extraction (see [`extractor`](extractor) folder for details)
3. Hybrid Extraction

We consider two generation frameworks, which can be visualized in Fig.3.
1. Vanilla Sequence to Sequence
2. Jointly Sequence to Sequence and Sequence Labeling

## Bias
To characterize potential bias existing in reviews, we define aspect score as the percentage of positive occurrences with respect to each review's aspects.

### Absolute bias
Absolute bias can be visualized directly by plotting the aspect scores of different groups w.r.t each aspect. An example is shown in Fig.4.

### Relative bias
Relative bias quantifies the relative favor for certain groups between human reviewers and system reviewers. And we define a metric called disparity difference to measure relative bias. The calculation of disparity difference can be visualized in Fig.5.

## Challenges

We summarize eight challenges in the pursuit of a good review generation system.
1. Model
    - Long Document Modeling
    - Pre-trained Model for Scientific Domain
    - Structure Information
    - External Knowledge
2. Dataset
    - More Open, Fine-grained Review Data
    - More Accurate and Powerful Scientific Paper Parser
3. Evaluation
    - Fairness and Bias in Generated Text
    - Reliability
