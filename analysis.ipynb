Each point-wise local shape transform can map the SO(3)-equivariant global shape descriptor of the input shape to a local shape descriptor, which is passed to the decoder to reconstruct the shape and pose of the input point cloud. \\n\\nThe proposed self-supervised training pipeline encourages semantically corresponding points from different shape instances to be mapped to similar local shape descriptors, enabling LSTNet to establish dense point-wise correspondences via nearest point pairs between cross-reconstructed point clouds.',\n",
